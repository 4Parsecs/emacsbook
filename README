= Helps

I need many helps:
 - For whom can edit figures:
   I need one more layer to explain snapshots, like
   explaining and highlighting each section in fig.1
 - For whom are good at grammars:
   Admittedly I am terrible at grammars, so I'd love
   any comment on this!
 - For whom have some interests: 
   See TODO!
